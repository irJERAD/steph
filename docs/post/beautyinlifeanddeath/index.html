        <p>I left USA with a single goal: get her there safely.</p>

<p>I could see that whether we were right or wrong, the two of us were dying. Fighting a battle against forces so powerful that for the first time in my life, I actually believed there was something I wanted and could not do no matter how much effort I placed into it.</p>

<p>It was clear our individual mortalities would be called upon in exchange for their wishes. In discovering this we renewed our vows to each other only now speaking beyond death. We capitulated with a single request: for the notebook ending we had promised each other. Committed to dying while holding each other with our hands, we took steps to enforce it artificially under black if necessary.
In her Eve-state she saw herself unable to continue taking pain on behalf of my inability to conceive of such wickedness that I could not see with my own eyes. In this inevitability, I would die while not with her (as it is now all the more clear, her capacity to save is not exclusive to the world).
When this happened, she promised her body and life to God. Predictably in my body of disbelief, I had not taken the situation as gave as the reality was. Still I considered the situation had a possibility through more natural conditions - and so I wrote to her: “.. find me in the one we know..” which she knew to mean if she required a marriage and future husband to seek me in the feathered lion.</p>

<p>After her bold escape and my estrangement. After traveling the world a second time.</p>

<p>The second time around gave ones who would work in the shadows the foresight to know what colors to shade. This time everyone came to the viewing with the perfectly skewed perspective so that as we walked right into a brilliantly architected trap, it would appear as though such travesty was the design of our own ill nature.</p>

<p>The disparity in the hearts of those who knew us and were resistant to the frequencies that erased our lives in the minds of the world was gut wrench but no longer enough to hold off the growing swell of anger in everyone else.</p>

<p>The power of your feelings. The reach of your hearts voice is SO powerful. As these false images were sent out the world was watching - most unknowingly. Their hearts wilting over an engagement that no longer existed outside the sole regret of her outspoken and now vanishing history.</p>
