The truest test of commitment is loyalty. <br>
The hardest test of loyalty is confessing failure. <br>

# The Game

Putting your vows and commitment to each other up to the test. <br>
**Are you preparing to take your relationship to the next level?** <br>
Considering a proposal? <br>
thinking about moving-in together? <br>
Looking to grow your family? <br>

All of these situations require a certain amount of loyalty toward each other as your commitments demand more. <br>

The commitment in a relationship can be checked via loyalty. <br>
As with all things in life, failure is to be expected and planned for. <br>
How can we plan for a failure in loyalty? <br>
Put together a failure procedure: <br>
When loyalty of either partner fails, they should know how their partner wants this handled. <br>

Some may have prefer to keep the episode out of mind and wish their partner to work their hardest to make sure what happens never sees the light of day. <br>
Since this is a difficult task to promise, the other form would be to bring what happened to your partner. <br>

From the first month in my relationship I put forward a simple message: <br>
"If you ever cheat, just tell me. Don't try and hide it. <br>
If we trust each other we can fix anything. <br>
If we are not honest with each other, we will not have the trust to overcome such obstacles." <br>


#### The Solution

Put your relationship to the test by commiting the ultimate act of treachery, cheating on your partner. <br>
The test then is whether you instinct leads you straight to your partner to confess and work on your relationship. <br>

How did this make your partner feel? <br>
How did you feel about this? <br>
How can you both help each other make sure this does not happen again? <br>
