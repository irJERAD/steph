This December 2019 an asteroid the size of the Empire State Building may be hitting our planet.  
This much mass striking the planet is a statewide disaster.  
Adding to the destructive force of this asteroid’s mass is the velocity it has picked up. Only four months ago on August 10, QQ23 passed as a near earth object. Already back, it has swung around the sun and gained kinetic energy adding to its destructive force.

## Plan of Attack: Every Angle
Goal is to tilt the asteroid off trajectory enough to completely miss earth.  We want to be cautious not to place too much force in the rock as to break it into more dangerous near earth objects.
* Use consistent force from earth and satellite based lasers
* Send over extra mass to offset Astroid
* Send over portholes to offset trajectory 

The last 8 months since April 2019, there has been a striking number of these large near earth object swing through.  
August 10
September 13
September 14
November 3 2015 JD1 (similar to 1862 Apollo)
