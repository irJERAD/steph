On this day of our lord September 9, 2019, while I am still of right mind and clear forsight, wish to make a few things clear:

I don’t want anyone suing no one.
Please do not sue people from my life.
companies in my life that I worked for or shopped at or was serviced by.

Please pay no attention to NLP practices that may have been played on me - unless explicitly or poetically called out herein on this site (in which case, the public shame should suffice).

If some bad stuff happened, I would appreciate it if it were talked about and made public as to help others avoid similar situations being played out on others.

For example:
People should be open and honest and share information with each other.
Being left out, or chastised or left to feel as though they are insane or [mentally ill](link article about what it’s like to be crazy).
