Richard Hess Hamilton joined the Navy in the beginning of World War II.  <br>

His first service was on a destroyer over the Atlantic. <br>

The destroyer was sunk on his first trip. As the boat was chewed up, a clock off the officers deck found its way to the raft with Richardâ€™s pack. <br>

Conceived in Chicago, Elizabeth Hamilton gave birth to Sandra Hamilton in Hawaii.  <br> 

R. H. Hamilton finished his war time service in Hawaii. Here the country welcomed an era of Military peace while they ushered the dawn of a new form of conflict - The Cold War.  
A menagerie of finely combed procedures and tight lipped secret pushing bread with the experimental offspring of emergent technology and a nascent global information empire upon which the future of nation building and destroying warfare was build.  <br>  

Perhaps it was this radical exploitation of a tediously earned skill in an environment that encouraged the promiscuous behavior he became infamous for later on in his years. <br>
