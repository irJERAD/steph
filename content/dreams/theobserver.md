Comfy in my cloth dress
I explore this realm
Looked after, maintained
Through my observation

Close your eyes, terminals
Screens on tables, aligned
Surface glow from metric input
Is this where I go?

Gradient, measured, intent
Absent ordered direction, I
Find safety glass separates us, along
A body, the horizon 
between all absorbed, and
All not
