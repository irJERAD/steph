Use this netw

* Make individual people their own wifi Access Points
* There is already data going through us
    * VoR [Voice over Radio]
    * DoR [Dream Scapping over Radio]
* We could definitely fit data streams over these channels as well
* Lets encode data specially to fit this purpose
    * With such a unique access point there are specific peculiarities to design arround
        * What type of data do we want access to:
            * Will this just be a text request
                * Static websites
                * browser compiled
                * device compiled
            * The Network
                * A collection of other beacon / Mine Radio heads
                    * Allows you to recall information like remembering from the tip of your tongue
                        * All those lucky guesses or hunches, feeling the answers to a test rather than studying and memorizing
                        * Knowledge has a metaphor not a memory
