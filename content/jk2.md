# Happy Wedding Day to Mr and Mrs J and K K

Reflect on this special day <br>
Drafting in us all a memory <br>

For those who took part <br>
their presence gifted <br>
For the one who couldn't start <br>
Taking place in his heart <br>

She so won the man <br>
how, I can't wait to understand <br>
Commemorating in a way <br>
Their inaguate day <br>

What a game she must play <br>
Now these two joust as one <br>
Their competition ups the ante <br>
Working as a team par none <br>
