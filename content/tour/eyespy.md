I spy within each little lie
familiar sentiment, fooled sentient, to
Lend that life meant more than that.

I spy within each little lie
familiar sentiment and fooled sentient.
Then lend life meant more than that.

I spy within each little lie
familiar sentiment to fool sentient, and
lend life meant more than that.

Case: A.I. bot defeats Turing Test by hacking and using a familiar voice.
The lie is in essence because the voice of a familiar person is used to make you believe you know them. Furthermore, the subconscious sentiment of hearing a female voice or that of your mother grants more credulity love and trust to this voice on behalf of your subjective history as a sentient being. Owed to this life being worth something more than the visceral intrinsic value set precisely before you.
