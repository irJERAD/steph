Oh look what we've done,
this school bus filled with everyone.  

We really need to unravel this madness to understand the architect behind our stories sadness.  

Apocali have been thwarted. Seasons canceled.  
Looking at How, How, How:  

It has been felt - This past awaking.  

We had so much excitement.  An audience of participants.  
Parts became partners.  Subjects our topics.
Adjacent angles, integral power-ups.  
Mothers lovers, and others lost.  

Untangled mess, still undressed;  
Mostly why I never here - ever required there.  

Once Libra's assigned Gemini weight
get a cash out
take their cow
no longer want a duck
shipped that chick
ego depleted by its final reason
for needed lease on  
future's mortality
