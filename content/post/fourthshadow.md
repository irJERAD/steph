Oh look what we've done, <br>
this school bus filled with everyone. <br>
<br>
We really need to unravel this madness to understand the architect behind our stories sadness. <br>
<br>
Apocali have been thwarted. Seasons canceled. <br>
Looking at How, How, How: <br>
<br>
It has been felt - This past awaking. <br>
<br>
We had so much excitement.  An audience of participants. <br>
Parts became partners.  Subjects our topics. <br>
Adjacent angles, integral power-ups. <br>
Mothers lovers, and others lost. <br>
<br>
Untangled mess, still undressed; <br>
Mostly why I never here - ever required there. <br>
<br>
Once Libra's assigned Gemini weight <br>
get a cash out <br>
take their cow <br>
no longer want a duck <br>
shipped that chick <br>
ego depleted by its final reason <br>
for needed lease on <br> 
future's mortality <br>
