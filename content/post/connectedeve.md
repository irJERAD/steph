It has been called voodoo, witch craft, magic, cursed or supernatural; connecting an individual with someone or thing else has been done for millennia.  
The most common form seen connects a subject with a doll and displays its potentials when a practitioner pokes a doll with a needle and the target instantly feels a pinch in the same spot.  
The mechanics are simple enough, map out the targets nervous system along the represented object or doll. Our nervous system is woven into a humunculous shape in the prefrontal motor and somato-sensory lobes of the brain.  

Imagine:  
- Connected bodies share disease and cure  
- When sick with disease the body does not consume more poison than normal.  
    the body produces more poison with what is already in it.

Examples:  
- A body with the cold is producing white blood cells equipped with the proper tool set to battle the cold.  With two connected bodies, the healthy one still produces cells capable of fighting the illness.  

Improved:  
- Cloud computing changed our technical capacity exponentially through the power of networking.  Now a common computer is capable of accomplishing tasks that previously required a world power's intelligence systems to compute.  
- A Network of people with a connected nervous system could work as a similar amplifier to the minds potential.  Access to a collective set of memories, experiences and knowledge elevates the platform on which our minds work from.  
- Connection to the peripheral nervous system provides auxiliary capacities for resolution
