Babe I so wished you were here.
My mom & I get along so well.
But sometimes, you know when we need a break from our loved ones.

I never needed a break from you because you were somehow influenced herself by then.

Them..I'm sorry about that I let this happen.

Like I can't really talk when my family is around like normal when we used to live I were myself :-)
I miss our days in La Jolla, in S.F.
...;-(

I think tonight I will cry over what I had most but everything that I worked for I can't let go ever

Thank you everyday for always beingthere for me.
No matter how, whom, what, when, what, and why

Deep down you <3
