Communing: <br>
    I have found myself in the presence of other worldly beings on many occasions. Whether dimensional, galactic of spiritual, am not sure. <br>

The first day I got out on my own I decided to take a walk to the beach. I was feeling uncertain, lonely, but couldn't find it possible to wear a frown in such a beautiful place. Waiting for Mahana Park to open their gates in the morning, I was approached by an enthusiastic man who I assumed was asking me about the park - _my first day and I already assumed I was the local_ ;-) <br>
Landri introduced himself and invited me to the church down the street for what I thought was an opening ceremony. I felt like I had seen the building before and wasn't sure what to make of it. Feeling something at work in our life for the first time in a while I was excited to get his number and invitation. <br>
I raced home proud to share I had not only made a new local friend, but was actually going to the church down the street. I was making plans, friends, getting involved in the community; I was growing roots. These roots would grow into a family tree I now see grew closer to home than my own country. <br>
The ceremony showed me how tight their community was there. My grandfather was an active member of the Mormon church and I always admired the framed hammer bent as though it served its purpose and was placed as a reminder. <br>

* Ecole Mahana <br>
    * Rehearsing and assuming a cultural flair to perfection <br>
        * Wilson and his dance moves killed it!! <br>
        * When I showed interest in something they would go out of their way to make it part of their schedule <br>
            * AND THEN master <br>
