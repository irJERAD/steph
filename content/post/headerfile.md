I certainty wasn't dying when this all got started: see my UCSF medical report in June 2017. Where I was sent for 3 vials of blood for testing as well as stool samples everyday for 3 days.  
The most we found was what looked like an error on the e.coli reading from her blood test; for which we were both given antibiotics for.  
This seems to be a way to normalize the sudden death of a healthy and happy young man at the prime of his life with his beautiful wife.  
Just look at our pictures, you couldn't have a couple like that getting ill and dying from the same disease so quickly when no one had even heard of it. Finding another sickness made much more sense.

The ultimate goal of this game was always plane and simple: to break the two of us apart.
The first time I ever heard about “the voices” she was telling me they had some plan with her parents to divorce us.
My naivety only beginning, I assured her it was all in our imagination and that no one had that intention, nor would they accomplish it without our deciding so.

There was never a deal made of a cheat for a cheat.

It makes absolutely NO sense what I had heard: that each time I smoke something illegal, she would lay with another man.

That sounds like terrible rehabilitation for the smoker, and it sounds like a dramatic end to lovers romance when the response is to enter their personal and sexual lives.

“I don’t want to make love outside marriage anymore” - she told me with a depressed face; looking down to avoid eye contact. July 2018

Shortly after she was brutal about making sure we had more since it was her way to hear the voices.
It seemed like she was trying to hear something, to figure it out. Then for days she wouldn’t leave the apartment without her father or me.
“Please don’t leave me” - as we walked from the hotel to her hair appointment.
There I would see the curly haired blond lady in her 50’s with what looked like the private eye from breaking bad. They were using the voices to intimidate me.

Months into the scandal and I found the smoke was fake. Something you could purchase legally at a store over the counter and was being used to make me look as though I had “Cheated”
This would free her up to “Cheat”


The memory problem, is there really a memory problem that everyone except for her husband knows about?

Is this why everyone seems to forget that before this happened I was a decent human in the eyes and minds of anyone who knew me?  
A Jacobs scholar at UCSD while studying Cognitive Science and Mathematics summer with CAMP LSAMP graduate scholars program.  
Provost honors when I started and finished with a solid GPA above 3.2.  
Participating in my community happy to give my time toward areas of passion I volunteered as a Jr Life Guard every summer, was an instructor for a surf camp teaching the blind to surf. I was drawn to Christian club at a young age always trying to understand my place so I could properly respect the improbable distribution of amazing and talented people in my life.
