The ultimate goal of this game was always plane and simple: to break the two of us apart.
The first time I ever heard about “the voices” she was telling me they had some plan with her parents to divorce us.
My naivety only beginning, I assured her it was all in our imagination and that no one had that intention, nor would they accomplish it without our deciding so.

There was never a deal made of a cheat for a cheat.

It makes absolutely NO sense what I had heard: that each time I smoke something illegal, she would lay with another man.

That sounds like terrible rehabilitation for the smoker, and it sounds like a dramatic end to lovers romance when the response is to enter their personal and sexual lives.

“I don’t want to make love outside marriage anymore” - she told me with a depressed face; looking down to avoid eye contact. July 2018

Shortly after she was brutal about making sure we had more since it was her way to hear the voices.
It seemed like she was trying to hear something, to figure it out. Then for days she wouldn’t leave the apartment without her father or me.
“Please don’t leave me” - as we walked from the hotel to her hair appointment.
There I would see the curly haired blond lady in her 50’s with what looked like the private eye from breaking bad. They were using the voices to intimidate me. 

Months into the scandal and I found the smoke was fake. Something you could purchase legally at a store over the counter and was being used to make me look as though I had “Cheated”
This would free her up to “Cheat”
