As of July 23 I, Jerad Acosta, have not been informed of any physical illness that either I or my wife, Stephanie Acosta, would have. <br>
I have been told to seek psychiatric care for the voices in my head. <br>

I have spoked with everyone close to me about what I hear in my head. No one acknowledges their existence; most tell me that I am experiencing a psychotic episode. <br>

It is becoming more apparent that I am supposed to believe I am insane and that most are already in on some translation of this secret.
Rhetorical justification is *reaching __critical Fugazi__*  
Reality mending pseudo rational has included:
- Was supposed to help my wife and I welcome a child or two into the world <br>  
- Help us survive a nuclear apocalypse <br> 
- Sophisticated ESR (extra special rehab) enabling us with next gen biotech such as MineRadio <br>
