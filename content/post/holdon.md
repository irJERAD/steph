Watching the sunrise  
Watching the sunset  

By my side, three turtle we named:  	
1. Athena Acosta  
2. Penelope Karolina  
3. Matthew Charles  
Whichever ones comes  
first, oh daddy <3  

Rewind  
Watching the sunrise  
Watching the sunset  

by my side  
my Tahitian goddess mama <3<3  

Ch She is  
She is a believer; hoping, wishing  

For all the “Places will go”  
are as perfect as if it were  
her dreams...  
Dreamer yet overacheiver  

Where is all  
started in our  
La Jolla community  
home condo  
I will have you eventually  
[I have through adventy]  

Be yourselves  
Be yourself  

Life’s Uncertainties  
Hold On, hold on to me  
                (Panda = Jerad)  
Just right in the middle  
                (grave vois)  


Life is  
But a dreamt  
to wanna  
succeed  
gotta  
persuade  
others…  

To succeed   
you have to persuade others  
[to support you]  

Hold on,  
Hold on to me  
Gotta find  
what sparks  
the light in you [to]  
that you can,  
illuminate the world.
