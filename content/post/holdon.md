Watching the sunrise <br> 
Watching the sunset <br> 

By my side, three turtle we named: <br> 	
1. Athena Acosta <br> 
2. Penelope Karolina <br> 
3. Matthew Charles <br> 
Whichever ones comes <br> 
first, oh daddy <3 <br> 

Rewind <br> 
Watching the sunrise <br> 
Watching the sunset <br> 
<br>
by my side <br> 
my Tahitian goddess mama <3<3 <br> 
<br>
Ch She is <br> 
She is a believer; hoping, wishing <br> 
<br>
For all the “Places will go” <br> 
are as perfect as if it were <br> 
her dreams... <br> 
Dreamer yet overachiever <br> 
<br>
Where is all <br> 
started in our <br> 
La Jolla community <br> 
home condo <br> 
I will have you eventually <br> 
[I have through adversity] <br> 
<br>
Be yourselves <br> 
Be yourself <br> 
<br>
Life’s Uncertainties <br> 
Hold On, hold on to me <br> 
                (Panda = Jerad)  
Just right in the middle <br> 
                (grave void)  

<br>
Life is <br> 
But a dreamt <br> 
to wanna <br> 
succeed <br> 
gotta <br> 
persuade <br> 
others… <br> 
<br>
To succeed <br>  
you have to persuade others <br> 
[to support you] <br> 

Hold on, <br> 
Hold on to me <br> 
Gotta find <br> 
what sparks <br> 
the light in you [to] <br> 
that you can, <br> 
illuminate the world. <br>
