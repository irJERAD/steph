We are turtle doves my wife and I <br>

One of us swims <br>
The other flies <br>

One lays eggs digging a whole <br>
The other nests atop a street pole <br>

One digs <br>
to burry its eggs in the sand <br>
The other nests in a tree <br>
high above land <br>

Moves slow <br>

Splashes about <br>
[swimming coasting] with the flow <br>
While she jets about <br>
chirping to everybody she knows <br>

Hello! Hello! <br>
And to you, a good day! <br>

Excuse me,… <br>
  … <br>
       ... <br>
 would you know …. <br>
 … what time it … <br>

“HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!" <br>

This chickie and I, <br>
we’re quite a pair <br>
my bird and I, <br>
we have so much love <br>

[each | two] halves of a whole <br>
my turtle dove <br>
