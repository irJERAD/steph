Paper scythe to reap without right
To speak, to grow, to know
The game played is one so old
Here comes the new
Crew loves their soon due
Quick to undue
What few care to clue in-to 
Much to see through
Punctured feed trough
Wisdom aloft
No place to be caught
From fair the foul got
What all would have not
Culled the stomach
Or pursued
This so
Blue
