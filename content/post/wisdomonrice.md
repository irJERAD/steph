With the quality of people I have to receive advice from it is not wonder the smallest of passages may be so dense in value they merit I study them for themselves. <br>

- Shoes for outside and slippers for inside <br>  
    - Leave the dirty unmaintained outdoors outside <br>  
    - Keep your feet off the cold hard floors <br> 
        - Hard floor is bad for our joints and bones <br>  

- When you are physically sick, you are spiritually vulnerable as well <br> 
    - It is easier to be influenced or possessed when you are physically ill <br>
        - The physical mind body and spirit are not so Cartesian as Descartes may have summarized <br>
