Our entire relationship has existed in the drawing energies of a monsoon. <br>

Drifting, blissfully together. Dreaming of many possible destinations. <br>

Ebbing along tides eroding with winds. Finding distance in our doubts. <br>

Anytime we drew near to the turbulent chaos, <br>
our inclination to circle rapidly <br>
and hold each other close <br>
came as second nature; <br>
though only perceivable in retrospect. <br>

We got to float by so many beautiful things in life. <br>
Gliding over islands, <br>
driving up a golden state, <br>
adventuring the empire state. <br>

Mmmm .. <br>
zwosh-sigh - I know you hate when I make that breadth sound. You never liked seeing a smile leave my face. I may have a resting smile simply from having you stare at me so often over our decade. <br>

anyhow, or Bref! <br>
It is so important to me right now in this moment that you receive the attention and affection I have so tightly wound up in me during these difficult times we’ve had the past two years. <br>

While I sat back building my self-importance as a redundant coach, you were always putting work in and counting any profits earned. <br>

I am grateful to find a place emotionally, personally, a state of bliss in respecting as much as I can of who you have been for me. And how you’ve well, kept me alive through it all. <br>

You were rarely right when we disagreed on big things. But something I really got wrong, was how great of friends we were; best friends.
Never alone, I’ll still always keep you with me. <br>

I feel more love for you than ever before. I know why. I so want you to be happy and you will always remind yourself how much you have put towards this moment. 
No more worries, its be happy time <br>
