Exhausted  
Tired of people stealing my shit.  

They started out taunting me as soon as we got there.  
For good reason, they never stopped believing that.  
I never let up on fighting for my innocents, for our fated spots.  

For what seemed like months I would spare with their club.  
Looking back I'm strangely fond of our little - Swedish House Mafia
