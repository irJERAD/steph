From the outset I want to make clear that any and all assets of significant material value are to be given to organizations functioning inline with my personal beliefs.

Having lived in fear and anxiety that my would be wealth was sought after by others close to me, both family and friends, I do not want any money, assets or future legal payment or attributions to be handled by my relatives or friends.

I know the emotional wellbeing of my wife and I was diminished by those close to us.  We spent our last two years constantly on the run from what felt like the roting of those things which we loved most; our cherished relationships with family and friends, our hopes for a future and family.

The cost of paranoia has been was our ability to enjoy all the things we took for granit. 
And Now we feel as though, the people around us want to take what envied our having and use it for themselves. Half the time it is as though we forgot the conclusion we came to - that others intented to remove and replace us - or simply could not believe something so sinister was breathing dreath from right under us.
