As long as I can recall I've been a beneficiary of life's more generaous ways.  

By the time high school came I felt caught up in a whirlwind of spectacle. I couldn't help but feel something special resided all around me.  

In Jr. high I would come home excited to lay in bed stairing at the top bunk. My imagination became my world. The emotions sensations felt indistinguishable. I kept returning to the same place doing this exercise over and over. Working off a few pages I read about transedental meditation I began working with simple visual constructs; a line, square, cube, then rotation.  

My eighteeth year seemed supernatural to a point I could not rectify what I felt with what I believed was expected; I did not want to accept the responsibility associated with what I thought I may have been perceiving or a part of.  (five fingers / mushroom caves, Erik Mind reading / share, one foot, feelings and stories)  

I took a detour in life.  

After a few years, always surrounded in this happenstance and pecular fortune, I found purpose and pride in my academic work.
