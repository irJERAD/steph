_this battle is fought along different lines against eclectic players across enigmatic fields_ <br>

Verbal Onslaught <br>
Masked magnetic resonant <br>
Psycho somatic blood clot <br>
wrought <br>
Sought within a thought <br>
Percolate Cerebro's <br>

_Employ artifacts of sentiment and intrinsic value in hopes of casting protective spells we guess against powers we imagine_

Protected self in <br>
Exotic Metal bent soft <br>
Curve this refracted signal <br>
to make talk <br>

_Act out in frustration to battle disembodied daemons, often searching through their serfs in self preserved innocence_

Seeking past the sender <br>
another tool, planned <br>

_Communing with the executors of our destruction. Dining with the bullet_

Mites target object of affection <br>


## Psycho Acoustic in Military

[The psychoacoustic effect of infrasonic, sonic and ultrasonic frequencies within non-lethal military warfare techniques.](https://littlefield.co/the-psychoacoustic-effect-of-infrasonic-sonic-and-ultrasonic-frequencies-within-non-lethal-cf05e1fd8673)


## Measuring Radio Listener Activity

[Portable People Meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_People_Meter)
Assess radio listener activity to measure engagement. Helps when finding value of commercial time, maybe user demographics and scheduling etc.

**There are several parts to the PPM system:**

- An encoder that inserts the tones subliminally into a station's or broadcast network's airchain via [psychoacoustic masking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoacoustics); <br>
- A monitor that checks that the encoder is working properly; <br>
- The wearable Portable People Meter carried by each panelist; <br>
- A base station for each PPM, where each panelist in the household places it overnight to recharge the battery; and <br>
- A portable recharger for vacations and other trips away from the home base. <br>
