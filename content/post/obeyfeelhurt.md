I have been known to lean a little paranoid. I have little faith in what disembodied voices tell me; particularly when it sounds grave for my wife or I. <br> 
They never have shown a desire for our better. The first thing my wife heard in June 2017 was that her parents wanted us to divorce. <br>
6 months later when they finally came around to me they still haunted her with the same message. <br>
Expecting my irreverence to that message I always heard about my wife being taken advantage of. <br>
