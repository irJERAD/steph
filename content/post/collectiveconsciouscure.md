Mind over matter is a powerful mantra. <br>
Traversing faith past belief and into a simple and plain matter of fact fuels this into. <br>

We do not consume the toxins that make us ill, rather our body miss-produces and reproduces the malformed cells that derail our health. <br>
Chemo is a dangerous attempt at [strategically] killing off cells to provide an opportunity for a reset of the corrupted zone. <br>
What if we could interrupt this process using a strategy from management science: on-boarding. <br>
Inject the body with a perfectly trained coach to lead the march toward reprogrammed health. <br>

Our autonomic nervous system acts as the bodies manager checking vitals and managing communication across organs over time.
Flares are sent up to the central nervous system for the triaging and prioritization of performance reviews up to conscious awareness in forms of “I’m hungry” “Ouch, that hurts”. <br>
