Couldn’t seem to digest this so I spit it up. <br>

Do my eyes look dilated? <br>
My chest seems barreled, <br>
Gut oddly inflated <br>
Have a look at this hair; <br>


Put me down for trying to shout <br>
Started to sweat, <br>

I swear this Oculus <br>
tear written in black hair <br>

Sworn off the feat they desire <br>
Cheat hack offered up, [like] <br>
Cake on a platter, fasting <br>
Like that would matter <br>

played off a a cartoon clown <br>
In a town behind the city <br>
pass through the valley <br>
clouds gripped by ridges <br>
can’t shake this battle <br>
Calling down the rain maker <br>

DNA designer bomb trying to find your <br>
thorn. Screaming at your toe <br>
I want you to know, <br>
you make the guns your rat <br>
setting up these traps <br>
when you’ve only goes so far <br>
by fouling natural law. <br>
turn away [before it] burn[s] your cornea <br>
look back no paw, talons <br>
glisten on my claw <br>


[Speak aloud] <br>
[Take / spew] [the / this] hate out loud <br>
gased foul air, <br>

Take this hate out loud <br>
gassed did fail before I could foul <br>
It won’t help this plastic killing faster than cows <br>
break our elastic carbon [and / to] methane <br> 
addiction to explain a discomfort <br>
hired an affliction so fatal <br>
my survival would kill the world <br>
so I can’t make plan <br>
so conform <br>

incept this coup de ta <br>
dug up the monkeys paw <br>
rewrite the natural law <br>
leapt from Andromeda <br>
Lift a pock a lisp, [for] a <br>
lapse <br>


Can’t stop myself from <br>
trying to save you from <br>
your own designed disaster <br>
got me glued at the water hole <br>
