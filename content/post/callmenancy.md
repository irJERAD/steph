Couldn’t seem to digest this so I spit it up.

Do my eyes look dilated?
My chest seems barreled,
gut oddly inflated 
Have a look at this hair;


Put me down for trying to shout
Started to sweat,

I swear this Oculus 
tear written in black hair

sworn off the feat they desire
Cheat hack offered up, [like]
Cake on a platter, fasting
Like that would matter

played off a a cartoon clown
In a town behind the city
pass through the valley
clouds gripped by ridges
can’t shake this battle
Calling down the rain maker

DNA designer bomb trying to find your
thorn. Screaming at your toe
I want you to know,
you make the guns your rat
setting up these traps
when you’ve only goes so far
by fouling natural law.
turn away [before it] burn[s] your cornea
look back no paw, talons 
glisten on my claw


[Speak aloud]
[Take / spew] [the / this] hate out loud
gased foul air,

Take this hate out loud
gassed did fail before I could foul
It won’t help this plastic killing faster than cows
break our elastic carbon [and / to] methane 
addiction to explain a discomfort
hired an affliction so fatal
my survival would kill the world
so I can’t make plan
so conform 

incept this coup de ta 
dug up the monkeys paw
rewrite the natural law
leapt from Andromeda
Lift a pock a lisp, [for] a
lapse


Can’t stop myself from
trying to save you from 
your own designed disaster
got me glued at the water hole
