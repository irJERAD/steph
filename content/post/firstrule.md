First rule is we DOM.  
reminiscent of "First rule is, we lie"  
sounds like fight club "first rule about fight club is, we don't talk about fight club"  

We don't hurt people who don't play / deserve it  


Lessons learned in time:  
Park the car in the drive way when playing to protect the house  

With this home as my chapel, radio my staff, herding of the sheeple.  
Press on for the next key, blow up any and all meek
