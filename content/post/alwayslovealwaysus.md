![jerad sleeping](/img/us/sleep.jpg)
One of Steph's favorite pastimes **taking pictures of Jerad sleeping**.

<br>

Something I should have been doing more of:
![public display of affection](/img/us/pda.jpg)
You always poked me about my lack of affection in public with you.. well, now we have a website ;)

<br>

![trying to be cool you](/img/us/hats.jpg)
There is always something for us to laugh about; mainly, ourselves.

<br>

Love at First Site!
![cool like us](/img/us/cool.jpg)
Our first time in New Zealand sparks were flying everywhere!!!

<br>

Sailing to Victory
![winning](/img/us/winning.jpg)
With our vicotry we laid the foundation for a new friendship.

<br>

Going on adventures 
![adventure](/img/us/worms.jpg)
Taking rafts underground with worms that glow in the dark.

<br>

Nothing but the best for us:
![champions](/img/us/cup.jpg)
First place is our place!

<br>

You can always make me feel good..

When it rains, we smile.
