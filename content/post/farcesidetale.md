Largest change of wealth and power from one generation to the next since the baby boomers.  

How could this happen?
* For 10 years Steph has been infatuated with me.
    * Then after 3 weeks apart (with her father gone as well) she has an apathetic distance
* I have always been surrounded by talented and amazing individuals who have cared for and loved me with such commitment and intensity that I have known very little else in life.  
    * One after another it feels as if those closest to me have fallen, committing themselves to joining this '_Tale From The Farce-Side_'

In-Laws
* “Be confident Jerad” “My daughter loves you” “She needs your attention"
