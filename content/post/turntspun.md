When feel off as though it should not be happening the way it is.  

When you cannot find the most common items in their familiar places.  

When the only logical explanation to such dissonance [see cDAP](http://palaver.jerad.xyz/toxicity/cdapvocab.html) that remains are inter-dimensional leprechauns then things are far down the wrong direction.


A man with a sick wife cannot afford to take care of her.  
Unable to get a job he cannot get medical insurance for her.  
In over a year he has only been called in for a single interview.  

In over two years a man has gotten together with his friends 3 or 4 times.
