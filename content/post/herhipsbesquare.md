Taking time to unwind
The show tunes
Caried out on this
Radio Mind.


She was 
so tuned to my soul.
Hips moved,
I could swear,
her square flowed 
with perfect right angles
Jaw dangled as she 
switched to her triangle.

Tried to hang low
To keep up with her flow
So trained, I would
Calculate her every curve
As straight. Down, Up,
And then found I could love
Past all and each mistake
So clear her every fault
Was just an alt-
Ternative view
On who it was 
That made it
Us.
