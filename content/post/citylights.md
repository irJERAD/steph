## Tricks used to scare victims into corresion <br> 


### General air pollutants <br>
Sulfur dioxide, an acidic pollutant, irritates the respiratory tract. It causes violent coughing when it irritates the throat, and may result in shortness of breath, lung edema, and pneumonia when it reaches the lungs. <br>

Both ozone and nitrogen oxides are oxidizing pollutants. Like sulfur dioxide, they cause respiratory irritation; ozone and nitrogen oxides, however, tend to be more irritating to the lung than to the upper respiratory tract. <br>

Carbon monoxide, an asphyxiating pollutant, binds to hemoglobin more strongly than oxygen does. Such binding produces a hemoglobin molecule that cannot carry its normal load of four oxygen molecules. In addition, once carbon monoxide is bound, the hemoglobin molecule does not as readily release to the tissues the oxygen molecules already bound to it. Therefore, tissues lack oxygen, resulting in many toxic effects. Because the brain is especially sensitive to the lack of oxygen, most of the symptoms are neurological. Lack of oxygen is termed asphyxiation, and thus carbon monoxide is an asphyxiant. <br>
