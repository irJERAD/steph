Paranoia is a social cancer; it starts with the ones trying to protect and grows into itself.


We are training terrorist when we allow ourselves to be motivated by terror.

Do:  
Live to die in our ways  
Not:
The Miss Taken Tragedy of mistakenly dying for another's.


Responsibility aux when wielding powerful tools
Driving has potential to hurt others.


Throwing money around decreases the value.


Always work with seek out and time the tide.
Rising tide raises all boats.

Burn the weak leaves to fertilize the garden.

Weak bodies and weak minds
