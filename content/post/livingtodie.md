Paranoia is a social cancer; it starts with the ones trying to protect and grows into itself.


Training terrorist when we allow ourselves to be motivated by terror.


We all live to die in our ways
Only the travesty of mistakenly dying for anothers.


Responsibility aux when weilding powerful tools
Driving has potential to hurt others.


Throwing money around decreases the value.


Alawys work with seek out and time the tide.
Rising tide raises all boats.

Burn the weak leaves to fertilize the garden.

Weak bodies and weak minds
