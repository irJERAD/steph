A turn of events
oberseved through a cracked lense                                                                                                                                         
Sick twists for an unborn Sibling 
Certain arc unrivaled meaning / purpose

[something being unraveled]
[different sibling positions as well as sibling origins]

[fortunate for a life time of training]
[past time with a pastime of lessons]
[Remember this point in time - expecting a future in review of itself; seeking this embedded knowledge]
[High Voltage, Low Oxygen, targeted anxieties, explicit fears]

[what is it I was preparing for]
[now that we are / I am / it is / they are here]
